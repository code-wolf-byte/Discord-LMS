# Discord LMS

## Problem
This project was inspired to move [City Monetssori School](https://www.cmseducation.org/) from a Google based LMS solution to a custom one over Discord. The primary idea was to use a bunch of common services offered by Google Classroom and Google Meet widely used in the Classroom and move their features to Discord with the help of Bots. 

## Arhcival
This project was set as an archive after a MSP was declined to be used by the School's administration as it would be too much work in training Staff and more to make viable use of this service.
